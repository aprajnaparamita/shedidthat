Front-end for the She Did That app

## Getting Started

# To run the local development env
`cp run_dev.sh.sample run_dev.sh`

Fill in the APP_SECRET in run_dev.sh. This is because the IP address
changes and iPad/Android testing needs to connect to the server by the
IP address.

# How to run

chmod +x run_dev.sh
sh run_dev.sh

# How to build
sh build.sh
