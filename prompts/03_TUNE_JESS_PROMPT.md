Paste this entire prompt into your local Claude instance any time Jess needs a personality adjustment.

I want you to improve Jess based on this feedback:

[DESCRIBE WHAT'S NOT WORKING — e.g. "she's too formal", "her questions feel repetitive", "she doesn't feel gay enough", "she's too short", "she uses the same opening line every time"]

Rewrite the full persona.md with these improvements. Keep everything that's working. Explain what you changed and why at the end.
