# Prompt 5 — App Store Listing

Paste this into your local Claude to generate all the copy you need for App Store and Google Play submission.

---

I have a comedy app called "She Absolutely Just Did That." It is a post-sex debrief chatbot for lesbian and queer women. The chatbot is an AI character named Jess — a loud, warm, obsessed best friend who wants to hear every detail about your sexual encounter and helps you rate it.

Key facts:
- It is a comedy app, not a hookup app
- No explicit content is generated — Jess asks questions and validates, she doesn't describe anything graphic
- Conversations are stored locally only, no account needed
- It is specifically for lesbian and queer women
- Tagline: "She may have left but we're still here, horizontal, ready to debrief."

Please write all of the following:

1. APP STORE (Apple) LISTING
   - App name (30 chars max): She Absolutely Just Did That
   - Subtitle (30 chars max): Your post-sex debrief bestie
   - Description (4000 chars max): compelling, funny, honest about what the app is
   - Keywords (100 chars max, comma separated): focus on discoverability for the target audience
   - What's New text for first release (4000 chars max)

2. GOOGLE PLAY LISTING
   - Short description (80 chars max)
   - Full description (4000 chars max)
   - Note any differences in tone or approach vs the App Store listing

3. AGE RATING GUIDANCE
   - What age rating should this app request and why
   - What content descriptors to select
   - How to describe the app's content to the review team to avoid rejection

4. CONTENT ADVISORY NOTE
   - A short honest note about the app's content suitable for review teams
   - How to frame it as comedy/wellness rather than explicit content

5. SOCIAL MEDIA LAUNCH COPY
   - 3 x Twitter/X posts (280 chars max each)
   - 3 x Instagram captions (with hashtag suggestions)
   - 1 x TikTok video concept description

Make everything funny, warm, and true to the app's voice. The target audience is lesbian and queer women aged 18-35.
