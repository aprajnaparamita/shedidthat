# Prompt 8 — Logo & App Icon

Use this prompt with any AI image generator: Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Adobe Firefly, or Ideogram. Variations are provided for each generator's quirks.

## THE CONCEPT

The logo for "She Absolutely Just Did That" needs to communicate:
- Post-sex glow / that specific satisfied energy
- Lesbian / queer identity without being a cliché rainbow flag
- Comedy — it's a bit, not a wellness app
- Warmth and intimacy — like texting your best friend
- The chatbot / phone call angle

The icon should work at tiny sizes (app icon on a phone screen) AND large sizes (App Store listing, social media). It must NOT look like a hookup app, a dating app, or a therapy app.

## CORE VISUAL DIRECTIONS (pick one or try all)

### Direction A — "The Glow"
A simple glowing phone or speech bubble, radiating warmth. The kind of glow you have after something really good happened. No people, no faces — just pure vibing energy. Think: a phone screen seen from above, warm pink/purple light spilling out of it, maybe a single sparkle or star. Clean, minimal, iconic.

### Direction B — "The Best Friend Call"
Two overlapping speech bubbles — one slightly larger (Jess) one slightly smaller (the user). The bigger one has a small crown, heart, or star on it to indicate Jess's energy. Hot pink and deep purple. No text inside the bubbles. The overlap suggests intimacy and conversation.

### Direction C — "The Afterglow Star"
A bold, chunky five-pointed star with a soft warm glow around it — like a rating, like a review, like the stars you're seeing. Deep purple background, hot pink star, golden or white glow. Could have a tiny subtle heart or sparkle incorporated. Simple enough to read at 16x16 pixels.

### Direction D — "The Initial"
A stylised letter J (for Jess) inside a speech bubble. The J is bold, slightly hand-drawn feeling, not corporate. The speech bubble has a little tail that curves playfully. Deep purple bubble, hot pink J, white background or transparent. Like a contact avatar but make it gay and chaotic.

### Direction E — "The Phone Wink"
A minimal cartoon phone (old school receiver shape OR modern smartphone) with a tiny winking face or a single sparkle on the screen. The phone is hot pink or purple. Very simple, 2-3 colours max. The wink communicates: "I know what just happened and I want to hear everything."

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS (apply to whichever direction)

- **Colours:** Deep purple #4A0E5C and hot pink #E91E8C are the brand colours. Use these as primary. Accents of white, soft gold/yellow, or very light lavender are fine.
- **Style:** Bold and graphic, NOT photorealistic. Flat design or very subtle gradient. Think modern app icon — clean shapes, strong silhouette, readable tiny.
- **NOT:** No clipart. No stock-photo energy. No overly literal imagery. No explicit content. No people's bodies. No rainbow flags (too obvious). No lips/mouth (too OnlyFans). No eggplant. Be smarter than that.
- **Mood:** Warm, celebratory, a little bit chaotic. Gay joy. The visual equivalent of receiving a "CALL ME RIGHT NOW" text from your best friend.
- **Shape:** Designed to sit inside a rounded square (iOS/Android app icon format). The icon should have breathing room — don't fill every pixel.

## SIZES TO GENERATE

Once you have a design you love, generate or export at these sizes for app submission:

| Platform | Size | Use |
|----------|------|-----|
| iOS App Store | 1024x1024px | App Store listing |
| iOS App Icon | 180x180px | iPhone home screen |
| Android | 512x512px | Google Play listing |
| Android adaptive | 108x108px | Home screen |
| Favicon | 32x32px | Web version |
| Social media | 400x400px | Profile picture |

The design must look good at ALL of these sizes. If it doesn't read at 32x32, simplify it.

## WHAT TO AVOID

- ❌ Anything that looks like a dating or hookup app (hearts, matches, flames)
- ❌ Anything that looks like a therapy app (calm blues, abstract brain shapes)
- ❌ Anything explicit or that could get rejected from the App Store
- ❌ Overly literal (no beds, no people, no suggestive silhouettes)
- ❌ Rainbow flags — too generic, not the right energy
- ❌ Pink ribbons or anything that reads "health campaign"
- ❌ Corporate clean — this should feel human and a little unhinged
- ❌ More than 3 colours — keep it simple, it's an app icon

---

## THE VIBE CHECK

Before finalising, ask yourself: does this icon look like it belongs next to Instagram, Spotify, and Notes on a phone screen? Does it make you smile slightly? Does it make you curious what the app is? Is it warm and a little chaotic without being explicit?

If yes to all four: that's the one.

---

## BONUS — Splash Screen / Loading Screen Concept

For the app's loading screen (shown while registering the device on first launch):

```
Full screen deep purple (#4A0E5C) background. Centred: the app icon (large, ~200px). Below it, in hot pink (#E91E8C), the app name in bold rounded font: "She Absolutely Just Did That". Below that, in small white italic text: "Jess is getting ready..." with an animated ellipsis. Bottom of screen in tiny grey text: "Your conversations stay on your phone. Always."
```

The last line is important — it reassures users about privacy before they've even started.
